## Spectator
  
I was, for so long,      
like the rescued,     
putting muscle    
to the banks of   
the riverwater,  
listening, to the    

voice, the jerking seat  
of the merciless  
weather, once wrapped  
in steel skin, now  
hung, like a fly strip,   
flapping, out like  

God, like some dirty  
wave, my freezing   
bones, my dull myth-  
ologized self, now  

I'm a snake, coiled up    
among debris, or buried,    
in costume, renaming    
the remains, always  
carrying, after the   
many forgetting, and  
the dead.
